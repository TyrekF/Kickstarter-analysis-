### Purpose
Analyzing fundraising goals that were hit in a short amount of time. Now, we want to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset we visualized campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the obstacles I faced was the ability to use countifs(). I was able to overcome the this by going through the module and comparing the code that was provided. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  During the first five months of the year the success rate consistently climb up until may. Launch dates   after the summer months outcomes goes into a downward slope.
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful percentages of outcomes are project goals that are less than $5000 goals or between $30,000 and $45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 The canceled theater data could have been voided. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  A bar chart would convey the dataset more approppiately. The line chart may be difficult to comprehend some price ranges and outcomes could have been voided for more clarity.
